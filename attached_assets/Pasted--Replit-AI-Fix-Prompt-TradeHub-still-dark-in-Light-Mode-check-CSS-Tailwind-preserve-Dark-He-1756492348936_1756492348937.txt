**Replit AI Fix Prompt — TradeHub still dark in Light Mode (check CSS + Tailwind, preserve Dark + Hero):**

Task: TradeHub still renders with dark surfaces in **Light Mode (`[data-theme="day"]`)**. Audit and FIX the root causes across CSS and Tailwind so the page uses the Light Mode tokens everywhere. **Do not change Night/Dark Mode** and **do not touch the `.hero` section**.

Do not modify:

* Any `[data-theme="dark"]` styles/tokens.
* The `.hero` section (no edits to its markup, classes, or styles).

Scope of work (Light Mode only):

1. Verify the theme switch actually sets `data-theme="day"` on the root HTML element and that this state persists on TradeHub routes. If it doesn’t, fix the wiring.
2. Check CSS/Tailwind **import order and layering**. Ensure Light Mode overrides are applied after Tailwind utilities via the correct Tailwind layer (resolve any PostCSS errors).
3. Find and replace any **hardcoded dark backgrounds** or **dark gradients** used by TradeHub containers/cards/sections that appear in Light Mode (e.g., classes equivalent to `bg-slate-900`, `bg-gray-900`, custom dark hex, gradient overlays). Convert them to use Light Mode surface tokens.
4. Find and correct **hardcoded light/white text** or **low-opacity text** in Light Mode that reduces readability on white backgrounds (e.g., utilities equivalent to white or 100-level grays, opacity-50/60/70 on body copy). Map to Light Mode text tokens with full readability.
5. Neutralize any **`!important` rules, inline styles, or overly specific selectors** that override Light Mode tokens unintentionally.
6. Eliminate component-level CSS imported **after** the global stylesheet that re-introduces dark styling in Light Mode. Consolidate so Light Mode rules reliably win.
7. Review all TradeHub UI parts: page background, section wrappers, cards/panels, headings/body text, badges/pills, inputs/filters, buttons/CTAs, tabs, and chips. Ensure each resolves to Light Mode surfaces and text tokens.
8. Confirm CSS Modules or scoped styles aren’t blocking global Light Mode rules; adjust scoping so Light Mode tokens apply without affecting Dark Mode.
9. Do not alter `.hero` or any `[data-theme="dark"]` blocks. Leave Night Mode visuals identical.

Checks to run:

* Search for dark-surface classes or custom dark hex used by TradeHub in Light Mode.
* Search for white/near-white text utilities or inline colors applied to body/secondary text in Light Mode.
* Check for gradient overlays that keep sections visually dark in Light Mode.
* Confirm only one global CSS entry is imported at the app root; no later imports override Light Mode.
* Ensure Light Mode overrides live in the correct Tailwind layer so they compile last.

Deliverables:

* Apply all necessary fixes so TradeHub fully reflects Light Mode tokens.
* Provide a short report listing files updated, issue types found (e.g., “hardcoded dark bg”, “white text in light mode”, “import order”), and the high-level fix applied for each (no code in the report).

Acceptance criteria:

* With `data-theme="day"` active, TradeHub background is light, cards/panels are light with proper borders, headings/body text are readable, inputs/filters/badges/CTAs render for Light Mode.
* With `data-theme="dark"` active, visuals are unchanged from current behavior.
* `.hero` section remains unchanged in both modes.
* No import-order or layering conflicts remain; Light Mode styling is consistent across the page.
