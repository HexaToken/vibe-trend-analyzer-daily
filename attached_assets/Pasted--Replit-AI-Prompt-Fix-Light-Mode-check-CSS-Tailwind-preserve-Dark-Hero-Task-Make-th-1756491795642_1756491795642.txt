**Replit AI Prompt — Fix Light Mode (check CSS + Tailwind, preserve Dark + Hero):**

Task: Make the TradeHub/MoodMeter UI render correctly in Light Mode (`[data-theme="day"]`). Audit and fix both CSS and Tailwind usage. Do not alter Night/Dark Mode or the Hero section.

Do not change:
• Any `[data-theme="dark"]` styles or tokens.
• The `.hero` section (no edits to its markup, classes, or styles).

Scope:
• Review all CSS, Tailwind utilities, and component-level styles that apply in Light Mode.
• Check for import-order issues (e.g., Light Mode overrides loading before Tailwind utilities).
• Verify PostCSS/Tailwind layering so Light Mode overrides are applied last using the proper Tailwind layer (no code needed in output—just perform the change).

What to audit and fix (Light Mode only):

1. Hardcoded dark backgrounds or gradients applied in Light Mode (e.g., classes that mimic dark surfaces). Replace with theme-token usage appropriate for Light Mode.
2. Hardcoded light/white text or low-opacity text that reduces readability on white backgrounds. Convert to theme-token text colors appropriate for Light Mode with full readability.
3. Any `!important` rules, inline styles, or utility combinations that override Light Mode tokens unintentionally.
4. Components importing extra CSS after the global stylesheet that could override Light Mode. Consolidate so global Light Mode rules reliably win.
5. Tailwind utilities that force dark styles in Light Mode (e.g., dark background utilities, white text utilities). Scope them to Dark Mode only or convert to theme-token equivalents.
6. Ensure Light Mode rules are layered to apply after Tailwind utilities (use the correct Tailwind layer internally—no code output needed here).
7. Ensure forms, filters, badges/pills, cards/panels, and headings/body text all resolve to Light Mode–appropriate surfaces and text colors.

Exclusions:
• Skip any changes within `.hero` or descendants.
• Skip changes gated explicitly by `[data-theme="dark"]`.

Deliverables:
• Apply the necessary refactors to CSS and Tailwind usage so Light Mode renders correctly throughout TradeHub/MoodMeter without affecting Dark Mode or the Hero.
• Provide a concise report listing: files touched, the issue type you fixed (e.g., “hardcoded dark bg”, “white text in light mode”, “import order”), and the high-level fix you applied (no code).

Acceptance criteria:
• In Light Mode, backgrounds, cards, text, inputs, badges, and buttons are clearly legible and visually consistent with the light theme tokens.
• No visual regressions in Night/Dark Mode.
• The Hero section remains unchanged.
• No import-order or layering conflicts remain; Light Mode styling is reliable across the site.
